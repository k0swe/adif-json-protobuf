# ADIF protobuf demo

This is a simple python script to demonstrate working with ADIF data in protocol buffers. It
translates a standard ADIF file to the JSON format described in this repository.

To try it out, make sure you have python3 and pip3 installed, then:

```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 demo.py /path/to/my_log.adi
```
